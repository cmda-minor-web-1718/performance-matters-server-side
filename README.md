## Start
Overview for now

Thinking about what to do....

Creating a setup with packages I think I might need
- nodemon
- express
- pug
- dotenv
- eslint
- body-parser

Took the express base from this link [here][express-base]

## Core functionality
Thinking about wha to do and how..... want to use wafs man....

Get the core functionality together for now:
- List all buildings
- Filter on specific buildings
- Get buildings between a specific time of from a specific time
- Get details from building

BTW: the data is not super accurate as the data comes from wikidata where everybody can add data as they want to.
And The build and demolish years, I hard coded in it.


## 

Add older script from client side version a.k.a. the helpers and made the query to the sparql/wikidata endpoint

Todo: clean helpers and check what is needed. Know more....
